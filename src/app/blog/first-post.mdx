# Welcome to My First Blog Post

This is a sample blog post to test the MDX implementation. The reading time should be calculated based on the content of this post.

## How It Works

The reading time is calculated based on the word count of the content. On average, people read about 200 words per minute.

## Why This Matters

Providing an estimated reading time helps users understand how much time they need to invest in reading your content.

## Conclusion

Thank you for reading this sample post. The reading time should be automatically calculated and displayed.
